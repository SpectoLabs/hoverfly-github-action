    name: Ensure dependabot version checks
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:

      # update the version manually in these places, too:
      #   - the default version in `action.yml`
      #   - the example version in the README
      #   - the latest version in the 'tests.yml'
      - uses: SpectoLabs/hoverfly@v1.3.0

      # update the version in `check_semver_labels.yml` manually, too
      # (eventually Dependabot will do this automatically and I won't need this hack)
      - uses: agilepathway/label-checker@v1.0.9

      # update the version in the devcontainer `Dockerfile` manually, too
      - uses: koalaman/shellcheck@v0.7.1

      # update the version in `github_tag_and_release.yml` manually, too
      - uses: golang/go@go1.15

      # update the variant version in the devcontainer.json manually, too
      # (see ../DEPENDENCIES.md#devcontainer-base-image-version for more info )
